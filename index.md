## About

---

Hi, I'm Juuso.
I am a computational physics student who is eager to become a data scientist and an expert in the field of machine learning.
I am currently working on my master's thesis and will be graduating this spring. I have always had a curious and analytical
mindset and I enjoy constantly learning new things.

Before I found my passion in physics, mathematics and computer science, I worked for several years in jobs
which required building and repairing things with your hands, but had a feeling that I need to move on to a
more theoretical field. That's when I stumbled upon physics and computational sciences and fell insanely
passionate about the subjects.

What separates me from the median university student is that I'm also a father of two small children, whom I had during my
studies with my long term life partner for 10 years.

In the future I will be publishing my own projects on this site.
